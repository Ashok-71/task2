# Task 2: Variables, Data Types & Type Conversion

## 📌 Internship: Python Developer Internship

This repository contains **Task 2** of the Python Developer Internship. The objective of this task is to understand how Python handles variables, data types, type conversion, and dynamic typing.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

* Python 3
* VS Code / Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

---

## 📂 Files Included

* `datatypes_demo.py` – Python script demonstrating variables, data types, type casting, and error handling
* `README.md` – Task explanation and overview

---

## 🎯 Task Objectives

The script covers the following concepts:

* Declaring variables of different data types (`int`, `float`, `string`, `boolean`)
* Printing the data type of each variable using `type()`
* Performing basic arithmetic operations
* Converting strings to integers and floats using type casting
* Handling invalid type conversion using `try-except`
* Properly concatenating strings and numbers
* Demonstrating **dynamic typing** by reassigning variable values

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Script

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system
2. Clone this repository or download the files
3. Run the script using:

```bash
python datatypes_demo.py
```

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

* Python is a **dynamically typed** language
* Variables do not need explicit type declaration
* Type conversion is essential when handling user input
* Errors during conversion can be handled using exceptions
* Python variables reference objects in memory

---

## ❓ Interview Questions Covered

* What is dynamic typing?
* Difference between `int` and `float`
* Why is type conversion required?
* What happens if type conversion fails?
* How does Python store variables in memory?

---

## ✅ Outcome

After completing this task, the intern gains a clear understanding of Python data types, memory handling, and dynamic typing fundamentals.
